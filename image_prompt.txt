Create a pixel art sprite sheet for a talking head avatar inspired by 1990s FPS games.
Input: I will provide a character face image.
Output: Pixel art with chunky 16–32 pixel blockiness.
Canvas size: 768×768px.
Layout: 2 rows × 2 columns (4 frames total).
Each frame: 384×384px.
Background: Fully transparent (no color fill).
Character Position: Centered in each frame, showing face and shoulders.
Frames:

Neutral (mouth closed)

Light talking (small mouth open)

Shouting (wide mouth open)

Smirk or raised eyebrow

Lighting: Consistent front-lit face.
Visual Style: Classic Doom Guy vibe, ~16 color palette, bold shading, sharp pixel outlines, no blurring.
Camera Angle: Consistent — no tilts or skewing.
Orientation: All frames must face the same direction — no horizontal flipping.
Alignment: All sprites must be pixel-perfectly aligned. The top of the head, shoulder height, and face position must be identical in every frame. This is a sprite sheet for animation — alignment must be exact.
